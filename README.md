# 🔩 Enhanced Joint Design for Robotic Arm (Onshape Project)

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on improving the design of a robotic arm joint to enhance its **mechanical strength and durability**, while adhering to the **predefined dimensions** provided in the task requirements.

The redesigned joint will be tested using **Finite Element Analysis (FEA)** and compared to the original version in the upcoming review session.

## 🛠️ Task Requirements

> Improve the joint design to make it more durable – while taking into consideration some of the previously provided dimensions.  
> Every submitted design will be tested through simulation using FEA and presented in the next meeting for comparison with the original design.

## 🧩 What Was Done

- Imported the original joint design into Onshape.
- Modified critical structural elements to improve load distribution.
- Optimized geometry while maintaining the required dimensions.
- Ensured compatibility with FEA simulation for strength testing.

## 🧪 Tools & Features Used

- Onshape CAD platform  
- Features: Extrude, Revolve, Fillet, Shell, Mate, etc.  
- Simulation-ready modeling for FEA comparison

## 📐 Dimensions

Key dimensions were taken from the provided reference image and applied accurately during the modeling process.
